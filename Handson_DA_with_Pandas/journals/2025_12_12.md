## Chapter 2 Pandas Data structure

For the most part, `pandas` objects use NumPy arrays for their internal data representations. However, for some data types, `pandas` builds upon NumPy to create its own [[array]]s.
If we need to ensure we get a specific type back, then it is recommended to use the [[array]] attribute or `to_numpy()` method, respectively, instead of `values`.
	- #### 1. What does "respectively" mean here?
	  
	  The word "respectively" tells you to match them in that specific order. In English grammar, "respectively" allows a writer to list two groups of items and tell you that the **first item in list A** matches the **first item in list B**, and the **second** matches the **second**. 
	  
	  In your text, the author is linking the **method you should use** to the **data type you want**.
		- **Item 1:** If you want a `pandas.array` $\rightarrow$ use the `.array` attribute.
		- **Item 2:** If you want a `numpy.array` $\rightarrow$ use the `.to_numpy()` method.
	- #### 2. Why not use  `.values` ?

	  The attribute `.values` is ambiguous. When you use it, you don't always know exactly what you are going to get.
		- **The Old Way (`.values`):** It tries to give you a NumPy representation. However, Pandas has evolved to support data types that NumPy doesn't handle well (like timezones or "nullable integers"). If you call `.values` on these complex types, the result can sometimes be unpredictable or inefficient.
		- **The New Way (`.to_numpy()`):** This is explicit. You are telling Pandas: *"I don't care what format you use internally, please convert this to a NumPy array for me right now."*
		- **The New Way (`.array`):** This is also explicit. You are telling Pandas: *"Give me the actual array you are using to store this data, even if it's a special Pandas Extension Array."*
		  
		  **Analogy:**
			- **`.values`** is like saying "Give me the money." You might get cash, a check, or store credit depending on what the store prefers.
			- **`.to_numpy()`** is like saying "Give me exactly $20 in cash."
			- **`.array`** is like saying "Give me the wallet itself."

	- #### 3. Why does the book use  `.values`  in the example?
	  
	  You will see `.values` in almost all older tutorials and books.
		- **Legacy:** `.values` has existed since the beginning of Pandas. `.to_numpy()` was only added in later versions (Pandas v0.24). The book likely uses it because it is "standard" legacy code that still works for simple data.
		- **Simplicity:** For simple data (like a column of standard integers or floats), `.values` and `.to_numpy()` do the exact same thing. The book example `place_index.values` likely contains simple data, so `.values` works fine.
